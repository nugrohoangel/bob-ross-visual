A network visualization of Bob Ross paintings sampled over The Joy of Painting seasons.

This visual uses node and link data created from information about Bob Ross paintings. This was a creative assignment from INFO 3300, Data-Driven Web Applications.
In this visual, links appear bewtween paintings if they share a majority of features, like snow-capped mountains or large trees in the foreground. 
Many of these nature elements were key signatures of Bob Ross' paintings.
